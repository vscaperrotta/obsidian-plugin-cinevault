# CineVault
#### Obsidian Movie Library Plugin

CineVault is a comprehensive Obsidian plugin that transforms your vault into a personal movie and TV series management system. It seamlessly integrates with the OMDb API to help you search, catalog, and organize your movie collection and watchlist directly within Obsidian.

Note: CineVault depends on the OMDb API for search and detailed movie data. You must register at https://www.omdbapi.com/ and obtain an API key to use the search and details features.

### Features

- Search movies/series via OMDb and fetch full details (plot, poster, ratings).
- Maintain a local library with watch status and personal star ratings.
- Fast add/remove movies from search results with full metadata sync.
- Local or linked-vault JSON storage (works on mobile).
- In-vault export of your library (creates timestamped JSON file inside the vault).
- Clean, responsive UI with grid/list views and compact detail modals.

### Configuration

#### OMDb API Key

To use the search functionality, you need an OMDb API key:

1. Get an API key from [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
2. Open Obsidian Settings → CineVault
3. Enter your API key in the "OMDb API Key" field

The plugin includes a default demo API key for testing purposes, but it's recommended to use your own key for production use.

#### Library Storage Options

CineVault offers two storage methods:

- **Local Storage**: Data is stored in `cinevault-json/cinevault.json` within your vault
- **External Storage**: Connect to an external JSON file outside your vault for portability

### Usage

#### Getting Started

1. Click the clapperboard icon in the ribbon to open CineVault
2. On first launch, choose to create a new library or connect an existing one
3. Start searching for movies and building your collection!

#### Adding Movies

1. Type a movie title in the search bar
2. Click on a search result to view details
3. Choose "Segna come visto" (Mark as watched) or "Da vedere" (To watch)
4. The movie will be added to your library with full details from OMDb

#### Managing Your Library
